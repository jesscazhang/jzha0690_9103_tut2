## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
The imaging technique I find inspiring is the displacement effect used in Apple TV’s *Severance*, where numbers tremble and distort in response to cursor movement. This is shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. This visual instability creates a sense of fear and tension, amplifying the user’s emotional response. Incorporating this technique into our project could emulate the similar feelings evoked from our selected artwork, *The Scream*. Additionally, pairing this technique with sound could heighten the sensory experience, creating a dynamic representation of this artwork with a focus on the human emotions of panic and anxiety.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
Object-oriented programming is a coding technique that can be used to implement displacement imaging. Figure 2.1 shows an interactive p5.js sketch of mouse-following dials. This technique enables modular control over visual elements on the screen as the user hovers the cursor over the artwork, allowing for movements such as trembling and distortion, such as the example in *Part 1* to mirror the feeling of uneasiness. This coding technique can be layered with additional elements of colour, changes in size, and sound to contribute to the user engagement and the desired emotional response of the user (e.g. fear and anxiety).

An example of the code for mouse-following dials using object-oriented programming is shown [here](https://editor.p5js.org/pattvira/sketches/kaFjH5TcN).
